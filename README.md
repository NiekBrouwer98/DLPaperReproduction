# Reproducing Deep Learning paper
In this project we reproduced a network described in the paper Attention-based Ensemble for Deep Metric Learning by Kim et al. This project belongs to the course CS4240 Deep Learning.

The network was trained and tested on the CUB-200-2011 dataset (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cub-200-2011)

The wiki of this repository contains an elaborate blogpost of this report.
